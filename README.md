##  Problem Statement

This project investigates the **integration of EEG and fMRI signals** to enhance real-time neurofeedback systems. A key challenge lies in balancing the **temporal precision of EEG** with the **spatial accuracy of fMRI**, and optimizing the design of **bimodal neurofeedback loops** that reduce cognitive load while boosting brain regulation. The ultimate goal is to provide **better therapeutic tools for neurological and psychiatric conditions**.

---

##  Objectives

- Combine EEG and fMRI data for richer, real-time neurofeedback.
- Compute and compare **Laterality Indices** and **Activation Energy** across unimodal (EEG, fMRI) and bimodal (EEG+fMRI) conditions.
- Use **Fourier transforms, statistical methods (ANOVA, t-tests)**, and **signal processing** to assess brain asymmetry and engagement.
- Visualize patterns of neural activation across different neurofeedback modalities.

##  Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

- **EEG & fMRI Signal Processing**:  
  Gradient artifact correction, BCG noise removal, ROI-based activation mapping.

- **Mathematical Modeling**:  
  - Fourier transform for frequency bandpower analysis  
  - Laterality Index calculations  
  - Activation energy estimation using temporal BOLD signal derivatives

- **Statistical Analysis**:  
  - **ANOVA and t-tests** to assess significant differences between neurofeedback conditions  
  - Interpretation of **p-values** and variance for modality performance comparison

- **Data Visualization & Analysis**:  
  - Plotting bandpower and BOLD signal graphs  
  - Time-series trend analysis using MATLAB

## Experimental Setup

- Real-time **motor imagery task** involving kinesthetic imagination of right-hand movement.
- Visual neurofeedback provided via a virtual "ball" controlled by brain activity.
- Six neurofeedback runs using EEG, fMRI, and combined feedback modalities.

---

##  Findings

- **Bimodal EEG-fMRI neurofeedback** yielded the **highest activation energy** in both EEG and fMRI modalities, indicating stronger brain engagement.
- **Statistical tests** confirmed significant differences in brain laterality under different feedback conditions.
- EEG-fMRI integration demonstrated potential for improved **cognitive performance** and **neurological interventions**.

##  Future Scope

- Incorporating **Graph Signal Processing (GSP)** to better model spatiotemporal neural interactions.
- Developing personalized templates for preprocessing pipelines using **signal smoothness** and **spectral filtering techniques**.
